# My implementation of the JOS kernel

The JOS kernel is a partially implemented exokernel-style kernel that students
of [MIT's 6.828 Operating System
Engineering](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/overview.html) finish
implementing through a series of labs. This amazing course's material is free
online, including all the labs.

This repository holds my implementation of the kernel. The original repository
is hosted [here](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/jos.git).

I am currently implementing lab 5, the file system.
